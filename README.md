Cricket Player Hierarchy

Description  :

This Python program demonstrates object-oriented programming by defining a cricket player hierarchy. It includes a base class, Player, and two derived classes, Batsman and Bowler. Each class has a play() method with customized messages to represent different player roles in cricket.

Classes  :

  Player: The base class representing a cricket player. It includes an __init__ method to initialize the player's name and a play() method that prints a generic message indicating that the player is playing cricket.

  Batsman: A derived class from Player that overrides the play() method to print a message specific to a batsman, including their name.

  Bowler: Another derived class from Player that overrides the play() method to print a message specific to a bowler, including their name.


Usage  :

  Run the script in a Python environment.

  The program will prompt you to enter the name of a cricket player.

  It will then create objects for a batsman and a bowler, using the provided name.

  The play() method for each object will be called, displaying personalized messages for the respective player roles.
